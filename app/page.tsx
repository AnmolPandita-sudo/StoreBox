        Hey there! Welcome to our Dropbox 2.0 project! We've been working hard
        on this to provide you with a cool platform for storing and sharing your
        files. However, there are a few things you should know. We've put in
        some security measures, but just like any project, it's not foolproof,
        so please be cautious with your sensitive information. Sometimes the
        service might go down for maintenance or other technical stuff, so bear
        with us during those times. Also, if you click on any links we provide
        to other websites, just know that we're not responsible for what's on
        those sites. And hey, remember that whatever you upload or share is your
        responsibility, so keep it clean and legal, alright? Thanks for being
        part of our project!
